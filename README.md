# Bank_Churn_Financial_Dashboard

Hey Folks! Here I am with a new Dashboard and some new learnings from a Bank Churn Dataset.

This is the small Introduction of the dataset I used:
The bank customer churn dataset is a commonly used dataset for predicting customer churn in the banking industry. It contains information on bank customers who either left the bank or continue to be a customer. The dataset includes the following attributes:


Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer
Surname: The customer's surname or last name
Credit Score: A numerical value representing the customer's credit score
Geography: The country where the customer resides (France, Spain or Germany)
Gender: The customer's gender (Male or Female)
Age: The customer's age.
Tenure: The number of years the customer has been with the bank
Balance: The customer's account balance
NumOfProducts: The number of bank products the customer uses (e.g., savings account, credit card)
HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = yes, 0 = no)
IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = yes, 0 = no)
EstimatedSalary: The estimated salary of the customer
Exited: Whether the customer has churned (1 = yes, 0 = no)

Steps taken on the data before using:

1. Data Understanding: Understanding of about which domain does the data belong, what is the industry?, what is it trying to get as a output from this data?
2. Data Cleaning: Removing null values and blank cells and converting them to NaN in Excel.
3. Data Modelling: Using DAX Queries and grouping different Age_Groups, Credit_Scores, Estimated_Salaries.
4. Data Visualization: Connecting CSV to Power BI and then focusing on the aim: How to reduce churn rate using this data over the Geography of Spain, Germany, and France.


Setting KPIs

1. Average Credit Score: Focusing on the credit score might help the bank to segregate the credit worthy people and non-credit worthy people.
2. Average Balance: Focusing on the balance might help the bank to push the promotional credit card offerings to high balance maintaining people.
3. Avg Estimated Salary: Focusing on the estimated salary might help the bank to push the promotional credit card offerings and other products to high salary individuals.
4. Avg Number of Products used: Focusing on the avg number of products might help the bank to reduce their efforts in the geographies where the number is more than the avg number.
5. Exited Customers: It is the most important KPI to understand how many people exited the bank's services and their age group, gender or credit score.
